#sq100
A replacement for the annoying original Software of the SQ100 pulse clock.
This project is based on the gh615 project: https://code.google.com/archive/p/gh615/

missing here:
- Links to the project's ReadTheDocs page
- A TravisCI button showing the state of the build
- "Quickstart" documentation (how to quickly install and use your project)
- A list of non-Python dependencies (if any) and how to install them
